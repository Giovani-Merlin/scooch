# Pull Requests

We support open contribution to this project. However we require that You fill
out the `./PandoraICLA.pdf` per the instructions therein. This simply gives us
permission to use and redistribute your contributions as part of the project.

You generally only need to submit a CLA once, so if you've already submitted one, 
you probably don't need to do it again.

# Code reviews

All submissions, including submissions by project members, require review. We
use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
[GitHub Help](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) for more
information on using pull requests.
